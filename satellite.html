            Modern comedies build from the established conventions of the
            various comedic genres; however, what sets them apart is the extent
            to which they combine various genres. One genre of comedy that has
            seen continued popularity throughout time is the comedy of manners.
            Oxford defines the genre as “A kind of comedy representing the
            complex and sophisticated code of behavior current in fashionable
            circles of society, where appearances count for more than true moral
            character,” though in the modern age, this genre has seen expansion
            past these initial boundaries. Modern comedies diverge from this and
            instead shifted to other genres including the sitcom; however, these
            modern comedies still build on the tropes of the classics. Modern
            comedies share many traits with "The Importance of Being Earnest"
            since they still rely on witty dialogue and satire of daily life to
            convey its humor.

                The play is set in Messina and centers around two romantic
                pairings that emerge when a group of soldiers arrive in the
                town. The first, between Claudio and Hero, is nearly altered by
                the accusations of the villain, Don John. The second romance,
                between Claudio's friend Benedick and Hero's cousin Beatrice,
                takes center stage as the play goes on, with both characters'
                wit and banter providing much of the humor.

            Oscar Wilde’s distinct flavor of comedic wit does not exist in a
            literary bubble, and instead he derived from earlier comedies and
            influenced future comedies. An early example of a work that clearly
            lends itself in the direction of Earnest is Shakespeare’s "Much Ado
            About Nothing." The play itself is simple and devoid of tragedy
            compared to Shakespeare’s more notable works; however, it remains
            well regarded as one of his finest comedies. The play itself partly
            revolves around a group of colleagues tricking their friends
            Benedick and Beatrice into falling in love through a series of
            follies. Earnest, although not directly inspired by Much Ado, shares
            numerous traits with it. Both plays feature two couples which run
            parallel to each other throughout the story, and the inclusion of an
            underlying plot which helps move the relationships forward. This
            plot though, it secondary to the dialogue and character interactions
            which provide the bulk of the humor throughout the play.

                Edward Albee broke new groud with his play "Who's Afraid of
                Virginia Woolf?" which totes the line between psycological drama
                and dark comedy. The play won both the 1963 Tony Award for Best
                Play and the 1962–63 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for
                Best Play. It is frequently revived on the modern stage. The
                film adaptation was released in 1966, written by Ernest Lehman,
                directed by Mike Nichols, and starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth
                Taylor, George Segal and Sandy Dennis.
              </p>
              <p>
                The play, set in New England, examines the complexities of the
                marriage of a middle-aged couple, Martha and George. Late one
                evening, after a university faculty party, they receive an
                unwitting younger couple, Nick and Honey, as guests, and draw
                them into their bitter and frustrated relationship. The title of
                the play alludes to the novelist Virginia Woolf as well as the
                Disney song "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Woolf?" Due to the high
                cost of licensing the song, most stage versions instead have
                Martha sing to the tune of "Here we go Round the Mulberry Bush."

            Wilde’s style of wit can be seen taken to a dark extreme in Edward
            Albee’s play "Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" The play centers
            around Martha and George, a dysfunctional couple and their
            houseguests. The play is unique in its satire of comedies and in
            doing so, it becomes a disturbing yet humorous psychological drama.
            Martha and George engage in a series of psychological games, and
            these represent the battle of wits found in Earnest and Much Ado
            taken to the dark extremes. These games tear at the couples’
            insecurities while also existing on a higher order of understanding.
            As a result, the two are portrayed as extremely intelligent and
            aware of what they are doing as their wit turns to psychological
            attacks. The guests Nick and Honey are shown to be not as acutely
            aware as the main couple, and it is this dichotomy between the
            couples that provides the dark humor found throughout the play.
            Overall, despite the darkness of the play, the extreme battle of
            wits provides a basis of comedy which then translates into the
            psychological drama.

            One of the most popular genres of modern comedy, the sitcom, extends
            greatly upon past comedic genres; however, it derives most of its
            tropes from the comedy of manners. One such example is Jerry
            Seinfeld’s self-titled television sitcom, which foregoes satire of
            the upper class in favor of satirizing the mundaneness of life in
            New York City. Seinfeld was pithed as a

              >"show about nothing"</a
            >; however, despite its nothingness, it is regarded as a true
            comedic innovator and one of the greatest comedies of all time.
            Seinfeld himself famously referred to his show as one where there is
            “no hugging and no learning” referring to the ability of a viewer to
            drop in on any episode without need for context. As a result, the
            show is still able to retain popularity with audiences who were not
            present during its original syndication. The show shares much of its
            traits with earlier comedies, and it modernizes many of these traits
            for the sitcom genre.

          <p class="my-5" data-aos="fade-up">
            One of the show's highest rated episodes,
            <em>The Chinese Restaurant</em>, defies many expectations because of
            its classification as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_episode" target="_blank">bottle episode</a>
            <strong><em>(see above sample clip)</em></strong
            >. Bottle episodes are episodes that typically reside in one
            location, utilize only the core cast, and forego extensive sets and
            elaborate costumes. These changes help reduce the overall cost of an
            episode, allowing the remainder of the series more budget to work
            with. Typically, this means that an effective bottle episode must
            rely on its script to carry it, and The Chinese Restaurant is no
            exception. The episode centers around the cast waiting for a table
            at the restaurant and their attempts to circumvent the misery of
            waiting. The exchange between Jerry and Elaine in which he asks “In
            a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?” is extremely reminiscent
            of exchanges between Algernon and Jack in Earnest, and the rest of
            the scene’s dialogue follows suit with witty one-liners. The next
            scene utilizes comedic pause to invoke humor as Elaine attempts to
            bribe the restaurant’s host. The ensuing miscommunication resulting
            from Elaine trying to hide the bribery pushes the tension in the
            scene to a climax through dialogue alone.

                manga in 2020 and is the 14th highest rated anime of all time according to AniList. The series is published in the magazine Weekly
                Young Jump and has been adapted into <a href="https://youtu.be/rZ95aZmQu_8" target="_blank">two seasons of anime</a> with a third

                romantic battles of wit to force a confession from the other.
                The council is rounded out by the intelligent yet airheaded

            "Kaguya-sama: Love is War", written and drawn by mangaka Aka
            Akasaka, provides a unique take on the comedy of manners genre. The
            premise of the manga is straightforward; Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya
            Shinomiya, the student body president and vice-president
            respectively, engage in a grandiose battle of romantic wits where
            each is forcing the other to confess their love first. The comedic
            style of the series hearkens back to the comedy of manners by taking
            seemingly mundane situations to intense levels of romantic satire.
            For example, the first chapter of the series sees Kaguya and
            Shirogane overcomplicating the simple premise of going to see a
            movie together <strong><em>(see above sample clip 1)</em></strong
            >. The tension between the two is brought to a climax when Kaguya
            asserts that Shirogane’s mere invitation is a confession of love.
            The wit in this scene is derived from the faulty generalization
            fallacy that the two fail to see, despite their high-ranking
            intelligence and prestige within their school. Neither of the two is
            willing to let their love supersede their pride, and the entirety of
            the series revolves around this internal conflict alongside the
            external romantic psychological warfare between the two.

          <p class="my-5" data-aos="fade-up">
            The most recent arc discusses the developing sexual tension in the
            main couple months after they have started dating, and Aka continues
            to use elements of wit that were used in the pre-relationship
            chapters.

            specifically, sees a meeting between 4 of the cast where they
            discuss developments in their families’ business and political
            conflicts. Kaguya stays out of this high-brow discussion, and when
            finally called upon, breaks the tension by asking “Do you all...
            ever think about sex?” After a one page pause in dialogue, the
            chapter continues with witty dialogue and over the top expressions.
            This comedic moment is reminiscent of the ways in which Oscar Wilde
            broke tension between Algernon and Jack in Earnest. This specific
            instance also reinforces the satire of the upper elite while
            retaining relatability to the teenage and young adult audience that
            the series is marketed towards. While not directly inspired by
            comedies of wit, in a

            Aka revealed a view on comedy like Wilde’s wit. He claimed that “The
            joy of comedy lies in the gap between expectations and reality. The
            larger the gap, the funnier something is.” Overall, the ongoing
            battle of wits, juxtaposition between the high-class setting,
            relatable situations, deadpan narrator, dialogue focused humor, and
            the comedic release of tension all contribute to the success of the
            series’ comedy and relate it to Wilde’s style of comedy in Earnest.

            Modern comedies such as Seinfeld and Kaguya demonstrate that while
            comedic genres change, the use of witty dialogue remains timeless.
            Nearly 100 years after Earnest, Seinfeld’s bottle episode serves as
            a shining example for dialogue’s ability to carry comedy regardless
            of the ongoing plot. Kaguya furthers this to the extremes by relying
            heavily on dialogue for the first two years of its publication.
            Although Aka has since developed an ongoing plot, the battle of wits
            remains at the forefront of the series as evident throughout moments
            in season 2 of the anime adaptation
            <strong><em>(see above sample clip 2)</em></strong
            >. In addition, the works discussed satirize the daily lives of
            their cast instead of developing extreme circumstances for comedic
            effect. As a result, Wilde’s style of comedy still remains relevant
            in the modern age even without the Victorian context. The works can
            be clearly seen in a progression as they were indirectly
            influenced by each other. Core elements of the humor found in
            Shakespeare’s comedy are also found in Aka’s, and Earnest serves as
            a perfect middle between the old and new. The comedies over time
            demonstrate that dialogue and its delivery contribute greatly to the
            effectiveness of humor regardless of its context. Even though modern
            audiences are not intimately acquainted with the intricacies of
            Victorian life, the comedic effectiveness of Earnest is still
            present. The 2002 movie adaptation of the play proves this idea
            through its moderate box office success. The changes that were made
            did not detract from the core of the play, and instead, they served
            to better caricaturize the distinctly Victorian elements of the
            play. In essence, Wilde’s comedy was not only effective in his own
            time, but also effective in the modern comedic climate because the
            techniques used are easily transferrable to modern genres of comedy.
